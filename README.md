# Grape Leaf Disease

The scripts are located in the scripts folder. The first one is using PBS, which is now deprecated. The second one is using Slurm. I've attached a template file in there with comments The logs are located in the logs folder. You can run Tensorboard to view the logs by using tensorboard --logdir logs The models are located in the training folder.

I've used a different conda environment for error analysis than for training. Packages are in requirements.txt, Python version is Python 3.8.18

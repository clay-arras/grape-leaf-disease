Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/slurm/506417/matplotlib-ikj1b6av because the default path (/home/nlin06/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
